# prime_prestudy_01

This assignment is for Prime Digital Academy's first week of prework. It is a simple JavaScript function, to practice what we had learned.

Files in this repository:
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js

## index.html
This contains the simple backbone of the app, nothing much renders on the page on load.

## styles.css
The stylesheet styles the header that the user sees when the page loads.

## script.js
The JavaScript file contains one piece of code, to console.log that the JS is working.
